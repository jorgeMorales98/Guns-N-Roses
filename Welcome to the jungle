Welcome to the jungle
We got fun and games
We got everything you want
Honey, we know the names
We are the people that can find
Whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey
We got your disease

In the jungle, welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your knees, knees
Oh, I wanna watch you bleed.

We take it day by day
If you want it, you're gonna bleed
But it's the price you pay
And you're a very sexy girl
That's very hard to please
You can taste the bright lights
But you won't get there for free
